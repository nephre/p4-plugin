	<b>View</b>
	<p>Lines to map depot files into the client workspace.</p>
	<p>Maps files in the depot to files in your client
		workspace.  Defines the files that you want in your
		client workspace and specifies where you want them
		to reside.  The default view maps all depot files
		onto the client.  See 'p4 help views' for view syntax.
		A new view takes effect on the next 'p4 sync'.</p>

    <p>To support migration from the old Perforce plugin, a View
        Mapping can be inserted from a file in Perforce.
        Add the depot path to the "View Mappings" field Prefix "@"
        (this only applies to the "Manual" Workspace behaviour).</p>
